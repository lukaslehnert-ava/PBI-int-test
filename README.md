# PBI-int-test

# 1. Introduction

This is a sample Power BI report that I created for a client. The report is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the client's sales data, including sales by district and item category. The report includes a variety of visualizations, including clustered column charts, area charts, scatter charts, and text boxes.

# 2. Report Structure

The report is divided into several sections, each with its own set of visualizations. The sections are as follows:

- District Monthly Sales: This section displays the client's sales data by district and item category. The data is displayed in a clustered column chart, with the x-axis representing the districts and the y-axis representing the sales figures.
- District Monthly Sales: This section displays the client's sales data by district and item category. The data is displayed in a clustered column chart, with the x-axis representing the districts and the y-axis representing the sales figures.
